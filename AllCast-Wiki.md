### Chromecast

Chromecast is now supported! To be able to stream to Chromecast devices, you must first update the Google Play Services app on your Android device. This sometimes takes a few days to roll out via the Play store for various regions. You can also update Play Services manually by following the directions at this link: http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/02/03/apk-teardown-download-google-play-services-4-2-refines-play-games-adds-cast-api-signs-of-auth-enhancements/

If you experience issues detecting your Chrome Cast even after updating your Play Services, please unplug the Chrome Cast from it's slot then plug it back in. We have seen this force an update that will allow you to detect the device. 


### PS3
PS3 is a DLNA browser, not a DLNA renderer. A DLNA renderer is necessary here, unfortunately.
The PS3 can browse DLNA servers (pull files), but it can not be used as a remote renderer (push files).

### Xbox 360

#### Xbox 360 Issues

The Xbox 360 does play back videos taken from an HTC One or Nexus 5.
