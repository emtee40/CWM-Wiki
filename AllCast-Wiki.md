### Chromecast

Chromecast is not supported yet. It will be supported next year after Google unlocks the Chromecast platform to all developers! I already have it working on my Chromecast, but until the general unlock happens, it won't work on anyone elses. :)


### PS3
PS3 is a DLNA browser, not a DLNA renderer. A DLNA renderer is necessary here, unfortunately.
The PS3 can browse DLNA servers (pull files), but it can not be used as a remote renderer (push files).


### Xbox One

Xbox One is a bit fussy to set up.
First, make sure you have the following apps installed:

 * Xbox Video
 * Xbox Music

Then make sure your Play To feature is turned on in Xbox One Settings. Turn "Play To" off, then back on again if necessary.

Yes, the HTC One (and Nexus 5) has some playback issues to xbox 360. I have the same problem .Xbox 360 DLNA support is lacking :(

I'm looking into workarounds. Apologies.
