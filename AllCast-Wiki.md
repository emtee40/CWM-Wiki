### Chromecast

Chromecast is not supported yet. It will be supported next year after Google unlocks the Chromecast platform to all developers! I already have it working on my Chromecast, but until the general unlock happens, it won't work on anyone elses. :)


### PS3
PS3 is a DLNA browser, not a DLNA renderer. A DLNA renderer is necessary here, unfortunately.
The PS3 can browse DLNA servers (pull files), but it can not be used as a remote renderer (push files).

### Xbox 360

Then make sure your Play To feature is turned on in [Xbox 360 Settings](http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/system/playto-setup). Turn "Play To" off, then back on again if necessary.

#### Xbox 360 Issues

The Xbox 360 does play back videos taken from an HTC One or Nexus 5.

### Xbox One

Xbox One is a bit fussy to set up.
First, make sure you have the following apps installed:

 * Xbox Video
 * Xbox Music

Then make sure your Play To feature is turned on in Xbox One Settings. Turn "Play To" off, then back on again if necessary.
