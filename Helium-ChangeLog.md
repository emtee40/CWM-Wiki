## Helium Changelog ##




**1.1.3.2** *6/11/2014*

Crash fixes for Android Lollipop! If you're running the Android Lollipop preview, please make sure you are on the latest version released on October 16th!

Lollipop, lollipop
Oh lolli, lolli, lolli, lollipop, lollipop

Call my baby lollipop, tell you why
His kiss is sweeter than an apple pie
And when he does his shaky rockin' dance
Man, I haven't got a chance



**1.1.2.7** *4/8/2014*

Fix that Google Drive up real good!

Sorry for the bugs. Feel free to contact support if your Drive issues are not resolved.

- Fixed some issues with Google Drive updating backups.
- Fix backup dates not refreshing after a backup.


**1.1.2.1** *2/7/2014*

Just fixed a 2 year old restore bug. Good god. Thanks to everyone that helped me by sending in logs and emails.


**1.1.2.0** *30/6/2014*

I live in a Material World, and I am a Material girl! (Updated for the new Material UI in Android L)


**1.1.1.8** *28/6/2014*

- Failed restores will no longer clear the unrestored apps. (Thanks Artem)
- Updated for KitKat to fix SMS restore
- Fix restore options menu crash
- Fixes for PC Restore
- New font for Android 4.2+
- Carbon has been renamed to "Helium" (trademark issue)
