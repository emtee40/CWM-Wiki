## Helium Changelog ##




**1.1.3.2** *6/11/2014*

Crash fixes for Android Lollipop! If you're running the Android Lollipop preview, please make sure you are on the latest version released on October 16th!

Lollipop, lollipop
Oh lolli, lolli, lolli, lollipop, lollipop

Call my baby lollipop, tell you why
His kiss is sweeter than an apple pie
And when he does his shaky rockin' dance
Man, I haven't got a chance



**1.1.2.7** *4/8/2014*

Fix that Google Drive up real good!

Sorry for the bugs. Feel free to contact support if your Drive issues are not resolved.

- Fix backup dates not refreshing after a backup.


**1.1.2.1** *2/7/2014*

**1.1.2.0** *30/6/2014*

I live in a Material World, and I am a Material girl! (Updated for the new Material UI in Android L)


**1.1.1.8** *28/6/2014*
